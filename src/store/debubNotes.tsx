    content: `Climbing places heavy stress on fingers, forearms, and shoulders. Proper recovery includes:
  - **Rest Days:** Give your tendons and muscles time to repair.
  - **Active Recovery:** Light yoga or easy climbs to promote blood flow.
  - **Proper Nutrition:** Sufficient protein and calories fuel recovery.
  - **Massage or Self-Myofascial Release:** Helps reduce tension and enhance mobility.
  
  Adequate recovery supports steady climbing improvement.

    content: `Front and back levers showcase exceptional core and upper-body strength. To progress:
  1. **Tuck Lever:** Bend knees close to the chest.
  2. **Advanced Tuck:** Extend knees slightly.
  3. **One-Leg Lever:** Straighten one leg, keep the other bent.
  4. **Full Lever:** Both legs extended.
  
  Consistent practice and core strengthening are crucial for holding levers statically.

    content: `An upper-lower split divides workouts into:
  - **Upper Body Days:** Chest, back, shoulders, arms
  - **Lower Body Days:** Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves
  
  Pros:
  - Allows higher training frequency per muscle group.
  - Balances volume for recovery.
  - Ideal for intermediates looking to optimize progression.
  
  Programming can vary, but a 4-day cycle (Upper, Lower, rest, Upper, Lower) is common.

  1. Light cardio (5–10 minutes) to raise body temperature.
  2. Dynamic stretches targeting the muscles you’ll train.
  3. Specific warm-up sets with lighter weights for your major lifts.
  
  An effective warm-up can improve performance and reduce injury risk.

  - Train each major muscle group in every session.
  - Suitable for beginners or those with limited time.
  - High frequency encourages consistent muscle stimulation.
  
  **Split Routines:**
  - Focus on fewer muscle groups per session (e.g., push/pull/legs).
  - Greater volume per muscle group in a single workout.
  - Beneficial for intermediates and advanced athletes with specific goals.
  
  Both approaches can build muscle effectively with proper volume and progression.
